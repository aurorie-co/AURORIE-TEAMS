## Install in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aurorie-co/AURORIE-TEAMS.git /tmp/aurorie-teams
cd /path/to/your-project
/tmp/aurorie-teams/install.sh
```

Then just ask:

```
@orchestrator "Build me a SaaS product from scratch"
```

_(the orchestrator reads `.claude/routing.json` to dispatch teams automatically)_

Just type a task — the system routes teams automatically.

---

## 🎬 What it actually does

### Input

```
@orchestrator "Build a crypto trading dashboard with real-time data and mobile support"
```

### What happens internally

1. Orchestrator analyzes intent
2. Selects relevant teams:
   - Product Team  (requirements)
   - Backend Team  (services & data layer)
   - Frontend Team (UI)
   - Mobile Team   (app structure)
3. Each team executes its workflow
4. Outputs are written to structured artifacts (each in its own task folder)

### Output

```
.claude/workspace/
├── tasks/
│   └── <task-id>.json
└── artifacts/
    ├── product/<task-id>/
    │   ├── prd.md
    │   └── summary.md
    ├── backend/<task-id>/
    │   ├── backend-implementation.md
    │   └── summary.md
    ├── frontend/<task-id>/
    │   ├── frontend-implementation.md
    │   └── summary.md
    └── mobile/<task-id>/
        ├── ios-implementation.md
        └── summary.md
```

Each task gets its own folder (UUID) so outputs never collide.

💡 You just went from idea → structured execution plan in seconds.

Each file is a reusable artifact — not just a response.

---

## 🧩 How it works

You don't interact with agents directly — the system does it for you:

```mermaid
graph TD
    U([User Request]) --> O[Orchestrator]
    O --> T1[Product Team]
    O --> T2[Backend Team]
    O --> T3[Frontend Team]
    O --> T4[Mobile Team]
    O --> T5[Data Team]
    O --> T6[... 5 more teams]

    style O fill:#1a1a2e,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a8a
    style U fill:#16213e,color:#fff,stroke:#4a4a8a
```

Three layers:

1. **Orchestrator** — routes your request to the right teams
2. **Teams (10 domains)** — each specializes in a function
3. **Agents (34 total)** — each executes specific tasks with defined workflows

> ChatGPT → one smart person
> AURORIE TEAMS → a full company working together

_Want to see the full system? → See [Architecture](#-architecture) below._

## ⚡ Why not just use ChatGPT?

Because real work is not single-step.

| ChatGPT | AURORIE TEAMS |
|---------|---------------|
| One response | Multi-step execution |
| Generalist | Specialized teams |
| Ephemeral output | Structured artifacts |
| Manual thinking | Automated orchestration |

You don't need one answer.
You need a team that executes.

## 🧠 Intelligent Routing

Each routing decision is explainable — not a black box.

Each request is scored against every team rule:
- **+1** for each `positive_keywords` match
- **−2** for each `negative_keywords` match (strong disqualifier)

Scores map to confidence bands:
- **high** (score ≥ 3) → dispatched immediately as primary team
- **medium** (score ≥ 1) → dispatched as secondary when no high team, or surfaced as "also relevant"
- **low / filtered** (score < 1) → suppressed

Example:

```
"Add a REST endpoint for user authentication with JWT"
→ backend: score 4, high → selected
→ product: score 1, medium → secondary (not dispatched)
→ market:  score -1, low  → filtered

"Build a SaaS platform with user requirements and API endpoints"
→ backend:   score 4, high   → selected
→ product:   score 2, medium → secondary
→ frontend:  score 1, medium → secondary
→ remaining: low             → filtered
```

Routing is deterministic at the rule level, and adaptive at the system level.

You can customize routing in `.claude/routing.json`. The `routing_policy` block controls thresholds.

### Debug routing decisions

Add `--debug` to any orchestrator call to see the full trace:

```
@orchestrator --debug "Build a SaaS platform with user requirements and API endpoints"
```

Output:

```
=== ROUTING DEBUG ===

Policy:
- candidate_threshold: 1
- confidence.high: 3
- confidence.medium: 1
- dispatch_policy.high: auto
- dispatch_policy.medium.when_high_exists: ignore
- dispatch_policy.medium.when_no_high_exists: auto
- dispatch_strategy: conditional

Evaluations:
backend: score 4, high → selected
  + API, endpoint, SaaS, platform
  - (none)
product: score 2, medium → secondary
  + requirements, SaaS
  - (none)
market: score -1, low → filtered
  + (none)
  - iOS

Dispatch:
  Selected:  backend
  Secondary: product, frontend
  Ignored:   (none)
  Filtered:  market, mobile, data, ...

=== END ROUTING DEBUG ===
```

When `ask` mode is triggered, an additional `Ask` block appears showing the prompted teams and user response.

Debug output is a pure projection of `routing_decision` — it does not change dispatch behavior.

---

## 🧠 Decision Policy

Control what happens per confidence band after classification — not a black box, a programmable policy.

```json
"dispatch_policy": {
  "high": "auto",
  "medium": {
    "when_high_exists": "ignore",
    "when_no_high_exists": "ask"
  }
}
```

Three actions:
- **`auto`** — dispatch immediately
- **`ask`** — prompt for confirmation before dispatching (medium band only in v0.3)
- **`ignore`** — suppress the team entirely

**Ask mode example** — when a medium-only prompt triggers `ask`:

```
Medium-confidence teams identified:
- product (score 2)
- frontend (score 1)
Dispatch these teams? [Y/n]
```

- `y` / `yes` / `<empty>` → dispatch all prompted teams
- `n` / `no` → suppress all
- Two invalid replies → treated as `no` (records `user_response: "default_no"`)

Ask fires at most once per routing invocation. High-confidence teams are never affected.

Customize in `.claude/routing.json`. The default policy reproduces v0.2 behavior exactly — no change required unless you want custom control.

---

## 🕸 Execution Graph

Selected teams are not always dispatched flat — v0.4 builds an execution graph so teams execute in dependency order, and independent nodes run in parallel.

**Graph templates (strict priority — first match wins):**

| Priority | Condition | Template |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | `data` in selected teams | data-first chain |
| 2 | `research` selected, no `product` | research branch fan-out |
| 3 | `backend` or `frontend` selected | linear pipeline |
| 4 | fallback | flat parallel |

**Linear pipeline example** — `product → backend → frontend`:

```
Wave 1: product (ready immediately)
Wave 2: backend (unlocked after product done)
Wave 3: frontend (unlocked after backend done)
```

**Research branch** — `research → [backend, frontend]` in parallel after research completes.

**Graph runtime states:** `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` | `partial_failed`

The graph is stored in the task JSON (`routing_decision.execution_graph`) — not just a plan, but a live runtime object tracked throughout execution.

---

## 🔍 Debug Mode

`--debug` exposes the full routing trace — every score, every decision, every field:

```
@orchestrator --debug "Build a SaaS platform with user requirements and API endpoints"
```

```
=== ROUTING DEBUG ===

Policy:
- candidate_threshold: 1
- confidence.high: 3
- confidence.medium: 1
- dispatch_policy.high: auto
- dispatch_policy.medium.when_high_exists: ignore
- dispatch_policy.medium.when_no_high_exists: auto
- dispatch_strategy: conditional

Evaluations:
backend: score 4, high → selected
  + API, endpoint, SaaS, platform
  - (none)
product: score 2, medium → secondary
  + requirements, SaaS
  - (none)
market: score -1, low → filtered
  + (none)
  - iOS

Dispatch:
  Selected:  backend
  Secondary: product, frontend
  Ignored:   (none)
  Filtered:  market, mobile, data, ...

=== END ROUTING DEBUG ===
```

When `ask` mode fires, an `Ask:` block is appended showing context, user response, and prompted teams.

---

## ⏸ Dry Run Mode

`--dry-run` shows what would happen without dispatching any teams:

```
@orchestrator --dry-run "Build a crypto SaaS with real-time price feeds"
```

```
Routed to:
- backend (high, score 4)
- product (medium, score 2)

Dry run — no teams were dispatched.
```

**What it does:**
- Full routing decision is computed and displayed
- Steps A/B (actual team dispatch) are skipped
- `--ask` prompts are deferred — `ask_required: true` is recorded instead

**Combine with `--debug` for the full trace without side effects:**

```
@orchestrator --debug --dry-run "Build a crypto SaaS"
```

Both flags work together — `--debug` shows the trace, `--dry-run` prevents dispatch.

## 🔧 Customization

### Customize behavior
Edit `.claude/workflows/<team>.md` to change how a team operates.

### Customize intelligence
Edit `.claude/routing.json` — configure scoring rules (`positive_keywords` / `negative_keywords`) and confidence thresholds, plus `dispatch_policy` to control what happens per band (auto / ask / ignore).

### Customize tools
Extend MCP integrations via `.claude/settings.json`.

---

## ⚠️ Safety

Use read-only credentials where possible. Review generated artifacts before acting on them.

### Details

- **Agents generate outputs — they do not execute external actions unless you do.**
  Agents write files to `.claude/workspace/artifacts/`. They do not call external APIs,
  run shell commands, or modify your database unless you explicitly wire that up.
  **Default behavior is local file generation under `.claude/workspace/artifacts/`.**
- **Nothing runs without your approval.**
- Avoid running on production systems during initial setup.
- Review `.claude/settings.json` to see and control which tools each agent can access.

## 🗺 Roadmap

We're building the AI company OS.

**v0.1 — Foundation**
- ✓ 10 specialized teams, 34 agents
- ✓ v2 routing with positive/negative scoring
- ✓ Lint + install test suites

**v0.2 — Observable routing**
- ✓ Confidence-based routing (high / medium / filtered)
- ✓ Routing test suite — 5 regression cases, CI-integrated
- ✓ `--debug` flag — full per-team routing trace in terminal

**v0.3 — Controllable execution**
- [x] `dispatch_policy` config — per-confidence-band behavior in routing.json
- [x] `normalize_dispatch_policy` — pure function, fills missing keys with v0.2-equivalent defaults
- [x] `apply_dispatch_policy` — Step 5.5 enforcement: auto / ignore / ask modes
- [x] Ask mode MVP — interactive confirmation for medium-confidence teams (at most once per routing)
- [x] Dispatch policy test suite — 47 cases: normalize (4), auto/ignore (4), ask (5), dry-run (5), phase1 (14), graph (15)
- [x] `--dry-run` flag — compute routing without dispatching
- [x] `--debug --dry-run` combined mode

**v0.4 — Interactive Routing Contract + DAG Execution (complete)**
- [x] `pending_decision` schema — replaces `ask_required: true` with full structured payload
- [x] `awaiting_dispatch_decision` task status
- [x] Resolve interface — `--resolve <task-id> all|none` (Phase 1 complete)
- [x] Phase 2: DAG execution — static graph templates, dependency-ordered wave dispatch, graph runtime state (pending → in_progress → completed | partial_failed)
- [ ] Phase 1 follow-up: Selective routing (all / none / selective team subset)

**Long-term — AI-native companies**
- [ ] Observability dashboard
- [ ] Agent marketplace
- [ ] Memory system
- [ ] Cross-project orchestration
